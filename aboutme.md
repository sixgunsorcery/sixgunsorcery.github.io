## Six-Gun Sorcery - The Idea

The idea for this podcast came up in the [Dark Trails RPG Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/darktrailsrpg).

Marshall Joan and I figured that since there were a couple of great podcasts covering the Apprendix N literature of our favorite game [DCC RPG](https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/) - namely [The Appendix N Book Club](http://www.appendixnbookclub) and [Sanctum Secorum](https://www.sanctum.media) - there should be a podcast for "Appendix W" that supplements all the Weird West gaming out there including David Baity's [Dark Trails](http://www.darktrailsrpg.com).

## Six-Gun Sorcery - The Content

This podcast will review and discuss. TV and Film, literature and gaming as it pertains to the Weird West and Appendix W. 

We might have some special guests and we'll most certainly have a rip-roaring time talking about weird stuff, the weird wild west and our favorite hobby RPG gaming.

## What The Heck Is This "Appendix N" Pardner?

We think that [this article on Goodman Games](https://goodman-games.com/blog/2018/03/26/what-is-appendix-n/) best sums it all up!
